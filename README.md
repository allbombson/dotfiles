# dotfiles
Non retarded distro agnostic dotfiles, get good or gtfo

### Notes
These dotfiles are mainly for use with my meta distrobutions runit scripts. 
Some programs and settings made need some tweaking depending on your setup.
Most shells scripts will have some ENV's you can edit to change it to work 
for your setup.

### Dependencies (For every program combined, if I miss any make a pr)
* a brain
* wpa_supplicant
* dialog
* findutils/busybox
* coreutils/busybox
* sed/busybox
* awk/gawk/busybox
